## Overview

This code utilizes for Dijkstra algorithm for path planning for a rigid robot of a certain radius and certain 
clearance from the obstacles. The obstacles are padded with robot radius and clearance

## Demo

Following demo is for following parameters:
```
Robot radius: 5
Clearance: 2
Start Point: (8,8)
Goal Point: (390, 290)
```

## Build

```
git clone https://github.com/rpande1996/Dijkstra_Goal_Detection_Algorithm
cd Dijkstra_Goal_Detection_Algorithm/src
python Dijkstra_Goal_Detection.py
```
Enter the following parameters:-
```
Enter radius of the robot:
Enter clearance:
Enter start node x postion:
Enter start node y postion:
Enter goal node x postion:
Enter goal node y postion:
```
Note: The start and goal nodes determine the position of the centre of the robot, consider the robot radius and clearance while selecting these coordinates
